# LLVM Toolchain for libhal

This is the LLVM toolchain conan tool packages for the libhal project. We
designed this tool package with the original purpose

Here you can find conan packages for the ARM GNU Toolchain packages used by
libhal project.

## 🏗️ Build Demo

```bash
conan create all --version 12.2.1
conan create demo/picolibc_test_pkg --version 12.2.1
conan build demo -pr demo/profile
```

The demo package will not succeed, but what is more important is that the
arm compiler and picolibc flags are present in the commands. They can be exposed
by adding `VERBOSE=1` in front of the command.
